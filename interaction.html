       	<h1>Making the Web Eventful</h1>
			<p>Javascript adds interaction to the web page. Javascript can respond to events such as the user clicking on an image. Javascript responds by rewriting parts of the HTML. Note, the events that Javascript can respond too can be as simple as the page loading.</p>
			<p>Javascript is a scripting language, unlike the likes the of HTML which is a mark up language. The key difference is that whilst HTML is just a series of tags used to give meaning and structure to some text and images, Javascript is a language that you as the developer can program, in order to have your pages do stuff – be interactive.</p>
			<p>As such Javascript has many of the common features of others programming languages – variables, conditional logic, functions, loops, objects and arrays. A grasp of these key concepts will help you in lots of other languages but Javascript is a good starting point because of its many uses in web design.</p>
			<p>The whole point of using Javascript within a web page is to add interaction very often involving outputting change to the user – in terms of different text, images, HTML or CSS values.</p>

			<p>It is the role of the HyperText Markup Language <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> to provide structure to your document.</p>
            <p><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is a markup language made up of elements that are nested inside each other to structure the information held in the document.</p>

			<h2>Presentation</h2>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> represent the presentation layer that prescribe appearance - the look and feel - of the a web page.</p>
<p>A key concept in the use of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is the separation of document content from document presentation. The <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> dictates the content, the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> the presentation.</p>

			<h2>Interaction</h2>
			<p>It is the role of Javascript to add interaction to a web page. Javascript can do this by intepreted the structure of the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> - known as the DOM - and change the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and/or <abbr>CSS</abbr> used in the document. Changes can be event driven, from user interaction, or programmed into the page, allowing Javascript to be used for all kinds of applications from sliding banner adverts to games.</p>
